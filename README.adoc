This plugin enables the Extended Read permission in Jenkins 1.324 and newer.

When this plugin is installed and active, a new column will be added to your authorization strategy configuration (for example, Matrix Security or Project-Based Matrix Security) in the _Configure Security_ screen.
This permission grants users and groups read access to pages that would otherwise require configuration or administrative permissions.

## Supported pages

The pages that currently support this permission are:

* Job configurations
